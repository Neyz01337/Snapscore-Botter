### How to use

`For Windows Users`
1. Install Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe">here</a>. It is super important that checkbox `Add Python to PATH` is checked on setup.
2. After Python is installed, you need to install the required modules that are used for this script. 
3. Open the file called `Install Requirements.bat`. This will do everything for you with no issues, simple.
4. You will need to install an android emulator. I recommend <a href="https://www.bignox.com/">NoxPlayer</a>.
5. Download Snapchat on the android emulator and login.
6. On Snapchat app, make a shortcut with people you want to send snaps to.
7. Run the `main.py` script with Python. Follow the instructions

`For Linux Users`

From your terminal (You will need to install Git, google it):

1. `git clone https://github.com/useragents/Snapchat-Snapscore-Botter`
2. `cd Snapchat-Snapscore-Botter`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install <a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy">scrcpy</a> (Allows for you to control your Android device over ADB on USB or WiFi)
5. Set up scrcpy and run
6. Create a shortcut in Snapchat with a list of users that you want to send snaps to
7. Run `sudo python main.py` and follow the instructions shown.
